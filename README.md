Test repo to get things up and running. 

This README edit exists to illustrate branching a github repository. You are probably already familiar with this practice. But it is a good exercise for me because I haven't used this system in some time. In any case, the same thing can be done locally once you have git installed on your machine, and that justifies the exercise in and of itself.
